# About

This project aims to collate all the small prime numbers available in [utm.primes.edu](utm.primes.edu)
It's a nice website that talks Specifically about prime numbers.
Why I decided to put this work in the internet is that, if you know the prime number properties, 
it may create a trouble when you have a collection for it. 

And may be this could help you do some tinkering and help you find efficiencies of your program, or algorithm. Who knows!
